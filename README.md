# Temp_Converter

This is a simple temperature converter that converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit. It is a simple Python program that takes in a temperature and a unit of measurement and converts it to the other unit of measurement.

## Installation

To run this program, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your computer. You can install Rust and Cargo by following the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Usage

To run the program, you can use the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will start the program and you will be prompted to enter a temperature and a unit of measurement. You can enter the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit and the program will convert it to the other unit of measurement.

## Other Notes

This program is a simple example of how to use Rust to create a simple command line program. It is not meant to be a full-featured temperature converter, but rather a starting point for learning how to use Rust, and this is also my first Rust program üòÅ.
